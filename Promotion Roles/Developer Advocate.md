## What is a developer advocate?
The role of a DevAdvocate is relatively new in the tech industry. 10 - 15 years ago developer software got sold to the head of department, the CTO, or the VP of engineering. Today developers mostly decide which technology they want to use. They hate to talk to sales people before they try it out themselves. But how do they get to know about a new product? How do they get started quickly? How can they learn about the benefits? Here comes the developer advocate for the rescue. It's like a peer that understands your challenges and needs without trying to “sell” a solution in the first place.

The role has a very loose definition. In general they help developers to get the most out of a technology or product and report the feedback into the organization that builds it. Therefor an advocate is running developer workshops, speak at conferences, create webinars, write tutorials, answers questions from the community, interact with users on social media, and much more. 

Even though a big part is to prepare demos and tinker with technologies not every developer makes a good advocate. The role requires a lot of empathy for developers, a passion for sharing knowledge, and a unique technical background.
## What you do
* Create content, videos, and samples from beginner to best practices that demonstrate how to develop and work with the product
